# Emotion Detection Using CNN and FER-2013 Dataset

## Tech Stack :  Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, VGG16, ResNet50v2, Transfer Learning, Gradio

Description : 
- __Addressed class imbalance__ in the FER-2013 dataset by employing image augmentation and class weights, improving model robustness.
- Designed and iterated on __custom CNN models__, including advanced architectures such as VGG16 and ResNet50v2, to optimize performance.
- Achieved a __66% overall accuracy__ on emotion classification, with the final model based on ResNet50v2, detailed through precision, recall, and F1-scores across 7 emotion labels.
- __Deployed the model__ for real-time emotion detection in live video streams using Gradio and OpenCV, showcasing emotion labels dynamically on-screen.
